## 👨‍💻 About Me  

I am a Full Stack Developer with a strong focus on backend engineering, software architecture, and clean code practices.

I build real-world web applications from scratch, applying principles such as RESTful API design, modular architecture, automated testing, CI/CD, and containerization.

I am continuously improving my backend skills, working with scalable APIs, authentication flows, database modeling, and production-ready environments.

My goal is to grow as a software engineer while delivering maintainable and well-structured systems.
